    ##
    # Distance between two points on Earth (Haversine formula).
    # Takes two points and an options hash.
    # The points are given in the same way that points are given to all
    # Geocoder methods that accept points as arguments. They can be:
    #
    # * an array of coordinates ([lat,lon])
    # * a geocodable address (string)
    # * a geocoded object (one which implements a +to_coordinates+ method
    #   which returns a [lat,lon] array
    #
    # The options hash supports:
    #
    # * <tt>:units</tt> - <tt>:mi</tt> or <tt>:km</tt>
    #   Use Geocoder.configure(:units => ...) to configure default units.
